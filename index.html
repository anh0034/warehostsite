                                    <p>another nothing day. i’ve decided to start counting them here, like how prisoners scratch little tallies on the walls in movies. maybe in real life idk! lol

                                        i biked in a big circle again for probably an hour and a half and that’s about it except aoife called. but we didn’t talk very long because she isn’t feeling well and had to go back to sleep. the weather is still gross but i can’t stand to be in the house all day</p>

                                    <p>surprised i didn’t get around to a blog post with all the screen time i’ve logged over the past 3 days. i think it’s fucking with my sleep. i’m very tired again

                                        anyway i did find an *active* technopagan forum ! it’s been online since 2005 which as far as i can tell is actually kind of late in the timeline of when people were really into this stuff, but for whatever reason it seems like the only one people still use. there are still archived posts from when it started and new ones almost every day. i’ve kind of fallen down the rabbit hole with it. there are even a handful of still active users who have been there since its inception :o
                                        
                                        idk why it’s so cool to me. i like that there are still old school forums even with everything being so social media forums now. no complex marketing algorithms or anything just good old fashioned fighting over niche interests on the computer. it’s like a little time capsule
