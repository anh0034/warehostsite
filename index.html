    Hello~!
Welcome to [domain name].


The writer of this blog definitely never imagined that it would be released 2 the public, but I figure the writer of this blog never would have imagined the things that have happened since either. I have left it as close to its original form as I could.


U can read the blog as-is or read the posts in order by skipping 2 the start and moving backwards.


Would U like 2 proceed?

    <button onclick="window.location.href='main.html'">
        enter
      </button>
</body>
</html>
